--The solution of given by course is the following (line 1-24): 
-- This is the first query:
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM population_years;
-- Populations of Gabon:
SELECT * FROM population_years
WHERE country = 'Gabon';
-- Smallest 2005 countries by population:
SELECT country FROM population_years
WHERE year = 2005
ORDER BY population ASC
LIMIT 10;
-- Countries with >100M population in 2010
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM population_years
WHERE year = 2010
AND population > 100;
-- Countries containing "islands"
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM population_years
WHERE country like "%islands%";
-- Difference in population in Indonesia:
SELECT year, population FROM population_years
WHERE country = 'Indonesia'
AND year = 2000
OR country = 'Indonesia'
AND year = 2010;
--Until here the code of CodeCademy
--My version of the lecture is;
-- This is the first query:
SELECT DISTINCT year from population_years;
-- Add your additional queries below:
--largest population size for Gabon in the dataset
SELECT *
FROM population_years
WHERE Country='Gabon' 
	AND population=MAX(population);
--lowest 10 population countries in 2005
SELECT *
FROM population_years
WHERE year='2005' 
	AND population=MIN(population)
ORDER BY population DESC 
LIMIT 10;
--distinct population over 100 million in year 2010
SELECT DISTINCT country 
FROM population_years
WHERE population >= 100
AND year='2010';
--select countries with the word Islands
SELECT *
FROM population_years
WHERE country LIKE '%Islands%';
--compare population from 2000 and 2010 of Indonesia 
SELECT *
FROM population_years
WHERE Country='Indonesia' 
	AND year '20_0';
--until here is my own code
